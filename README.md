# HS-EMO #

HS-EMO (short for hate speech and emotions) is a dataset of annotations for emotion categories for English Twitter messages contained in the corpus [HASOC 2021](https://hasocfire.github.io/hasoc/2021/dataset.html). This repository contains the anonymized dataset with emotion annotations as well as scripts of experiments. I am happy to provide the complete data to you, feel free to contact me with a motivated request.
